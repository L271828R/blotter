A Ulysses Rule is any arrangement in which you bind your future self in order 
to resist temptations and stick to long‑term goals. It’s a form of 
precommitment:

“I choose now to limit my future choices, so that when my willpower falters, 
I’m already ‘locked in.’”


. Ulysses/Odysseus: The Cunning Hero
Background

King of Ithaca, leader of the Greek forces in the Trojan War.

Renowned for his resourcefulness, eloquence, and longing to return home.

The Odyssey’s Journey

After Troy falls, he faces a ten‑year voyage filled with divine wrath and 
otherworldly challenges.

His ultimate goal: reach Ithaca and reunite with Penelope and Telemachus.

2. The Sirens: Lethal Songstresses
Nature and Appearance

Mythic creatures often depicted as half‑bird, half‑woman (later art 
sometimes shows them as mermaids).

Inhabit a rocky island, unseen by most but heard through their irresistible 
song.

Their Power

Their melody promises knowledge, pleasure, and foreknowledge.

Any sailor who hears them is enchanted to steer toward them—only to shipwreck 
on the rocks.

3. The Odyssey’s Sirens Episode (Book 12)
Circe’s Warning

The enchantress Circe warns Odysseus of the Sirens and advises a precautionary 
strategy.

Preparation

Odysseus orders his crew to fill their ears with beeswax so they cannot hear 
the song.

He alone wishes to listen, so he instructs them to bind him tightly to the 
ship’s mast and to ignore all his future pleas for release.

The Passage

As they row past, the Sirens begin their seductive singing: promising “to 
sing to all who come this way what happens in the wide world.”

Odysseus, enthralled, struggles and calls to be unbound—but his faithful crew 
only rows harder.

Safe Escape

Once beyond earshot, the Sirens’ voices fade.

Odysseus is released; the crew removes their wax and they continue on.

4. Themes and Symbolism
Temptation vs. Reason

The Sirens embody seductive knowledge and pleasure that can lead to ruin.

Odysseus’s self‑binding is an act of self‑restraint and forethought.

Leadership and Trust

His willingness to be bound shows trust in his crew’s discipline.

The crew’s obedience highlights unity under strong leadership.

Knowledge and Hubris

Odysseus’s desire to hear the Sirens reflects his insatiable curiosity—and 
hints at potential arrogance in wanting to experience danger firsthand.

5. Cultural Legacy
Art and Literature

Renaissance paintings (e.g., John William Waterhouse’s Ulysses and the 
Sirens).

References in modern novels, operas, and films as an archetype of irresistible 
temptation.

Metaphorical Use

“Sirens” now denote any irresistible allure (e.g., “sirens of fame,” 
“sirens of technology”).

Psychological Interpretation

Sometimes seen as a metaphor for dangerous obsessions or addictive behaviors.
